    <h1>Computer Networking</h1>
    <p>Computer networking refers to the practice of connecting multiple computers and devices together to share resources and communicate with one another.</p>

    <h2>Network</h2>
    <p>A network is a group of interconnected devices, such as computers, servers, and routers, that are connected together to share information and resources.</p>

    <h2>Distributed System</h2>
    <p>A distributed system is a network of computers that work together as a single system to accomplish a common goal.</p>

    <h2>Uses of Computer Networks</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>File sharing</li>
      <li>Remote access</li>
      <li>Email</li>
      <li>Internet connectivity</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Network Topologies</h2>
    <p>Network topologies refer to the physical and logical layout of a network, such as a star, bus, or ring.</p>

    <h2>Types of Channels</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Simplex</li>
      <li>Duplex</li>
      <li>Half-duplex</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Switching Techniques</h2>
    <p>Switching techniques refer to the methods used to transfer data between devices on a network, such as circuit switching and packet switching.</p>

    <h2>Repeaters, Bridge, Gateway</h2>
    <p>Repeaters, bridges, and gateways are network devices that help to connect different networks together.</p>

    <h2>Token Passing</h2>
    <p>Token passing is a method of media access control in which a token, or small data packet, is passed around a network to determine who is able to transmit data.</p>

    <h2>Protocols</h2>
    <p>Protocols are set of rules and standards that govern how devices on a network communicate with one another. The ISO-OSI model is a commonly used reference model for describing the different layers of a network protocol.</p>

    <h2>NIC</h2>
    <p>NIC (Network Interface Card) is a hardware component that connects a computer to a network.</p>

    <h2>Serial and Parallel Communication</h2>
    <p>Serial and parallel communication refers to the method of transmitting data, where serial communication transmits one bit at a time and parallel transmits multiple bits at a time.</p>
